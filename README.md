# Tusk-Launcher
Tusk-Launcher is a personal project i maintain for myself to achieve functionality i cant get anywhere else anyone else using it is along for the ride.
I rely quite heavily on ai to cobble this together and as a result the code base will remain functional but too inconsistent to accept outside PR's.
Reccomendations for features or bug reports are appreciated but if you are good at coding and see any potential I would reccomend you fork this project or use it as inspiration for your own applaunchers.


what it looks like with default theme.css:

<img width="515" height="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c75e19be-00bd-4e5f-83d5-57bbd0bc14dc" />



More minimalist theme:

<img width="700" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35572956-a948-42a3-ae99-a2d2e0d43d2c" />



#INSTALLATION

WIP:

Future plans:

allowing adding custom buttons that point to external applications in the css theme that would be displayed in the main window.
