# Tusk-Launcher
Tusk-Launcher is a personal project i maintain for myself to achieve functionality i cant get anywhere else anyone else using it is along for the ride.
I rely quite heavily on ai to cobble this together and as a result the code base will remain functional but too inconsistent to accept outside PR's.
Reccomendations for features or bug reports are appreciated but if you are good at coding and see any potential I would reccomend you fork this project or use it as inspiration for your own applaunchers.
